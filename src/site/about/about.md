<p id="about" data-scroll-point>I’m a “front of the frontend” software engineering leader who loves supporting teams working with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jamstack</a>, React, CSS (😍), design systems, and accessibility.</p>

I’m a former co-host of the devchat.tv podcast <a href="https://reactroundup.com/hosts/lesliecohn-wein" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">React Round Up</a>, and my agency work was nominated for a Webby and 4x Awwwards. A site I developed in 2018 won the prestigious <a href="https://www.commarts.com/project/26022/the-parker-palm-springs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CommArts Interactive Award</a>. I’ve also written for CSS Tricks and LeadDev, and helped grow Netlify's frontend discipline from 2 to 12+ engineers during the startup's early years.

How did I get here? The first line of code I ever wrote was for my LiveJournal theme. I had a college internship building Drupal and WordPress sites for nonprofits; a few years later, I was developing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155138/http://nesremix.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sites for Nintendo</a>.

As an agency developer, I saw firsthand how the Jamstack would revolutionize the web. I loved it so much that I joined Netlify in 2018 as employee number 30-something, where I <a href="https://twitter.com/lesliecdubs/status/1207770216576487425" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worked on the React app</a> that powers <a href="https://app.netlify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">app.netlify.com</a> and later managed the burgeoning growth engineering team.

In 2022, I went to work on my other favorite dev tool: <a href="https://github.com" ref="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Combining my love of UI, accessibility, and systems thinking, I joined as an engineering manager to support the teams who build <a href="https://primer.style/about/#team/" ref="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Primer</a> and bring GitHub's brand to life through creative code.

In my spare time, I frequent the <a href="http://meetup.com/reactjsdallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ReactJS Dallas</a> and <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/dfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Women Who Code DFW</a> meetups, volunteer at <a href="https://jfsdallas.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jewish Family Service</a>, teach ninth grade religious school, play board games, host dinner parties, and hang out with my <a href="http://www.thejoyfulbelly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">(chef) spouse Eli</a> and our basset hound mix <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dammitmacklin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FBI Agent Burt "Mack" Macklin</a>.
