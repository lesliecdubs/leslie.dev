## <a name="about">👩🏻‍💻 About</a>

I'm a "front of the frontend" developer who spends most of my time these days building products in React. (Don't tell the programmers, but CSS is my favorite! 🤫) 

I believe there is no "definition of done" without accessibility.

In my free time, I frequent [ReactJS Dallas](http://meetup.com/reactjsdallas) and [Women Who Code DFW](https://www.womenwhocode.com/dfw) meetups, eat good meals with [my spouse](http://www.thejoyfulbelly.com/) (a chef!), take walks with my basset mix [Burt Macklin](https://www.instagram.com/dammitmacklin/), volunteer on the young adult board at [Jewish Family Service](https://jfsdallas.org), and teach ninth grade [Sunday School](https://www.tedallas.org/learning/youth-learning-engagement/9th-12th-grade).
