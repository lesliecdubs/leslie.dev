## Speaking

I spend most of my time building, but every once in a while I say things:

- 🎧 [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/124): "Designing the User Interface at Netlify" with [Rafael Conde](https://rafaelconde.net/)
- 🎧 [React Round Up](https://devchat.tv/react-round-up/rru-066-accessibility-is-not-a-%E2%80%9Creact-problem%E2%80%9D-with-leslie-cohn-wein/): "Accessibility is not a React Problem"
- 📺 [Concatenate Conf](https://www.concatenate.dev/schedule/), Oct 2019: Spreading the JAM

<!-- ## Post pages

The pages found in in the posts

<ul class="listing">
{%- for page in collections.post -%}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.data.title }}</a> -
    <time datetime="{{ page.date }}">{{ page.date | dateDisplay("LLLL d, y") }}</time>
  </li>
{%- endfor -%}
</ul>

## Links from an external data source

These links were sourced from [hawksworx.com](https://www.hawksworx.com/feed.json) at build time.

<ul class="listing">
{%- for item in hawksworx.entries.slice(0,5) -%}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ item.link }}">{{ item.title }}</a>
  </li>
{%- endfor -%}
</ul>

## Prerequisite

- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running locally

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install

# External data sources can be stashed locally
npm run seed

# It will then be available locally for building with
npm run start
```

## Add some Netlify helpers

Netlify Dev adds the ability to use Netlify redirects, proxies, and serverless functions.

```bash
# install the Netlify CLI in order to get Netlify Dev
npm install -g netlify-cli

# run a local server with some added Netlify sugar in front of Eleventy
netlify dev
```

A serverless functions pipeline is included via Netlify Dev. By running `netlify dev` you'll be able to execute any of your serverless functions directly like this:

- [/.netlify/functions/hello](/.netlify/functions/hello)
- [/.netlify/functions/fetch-joke](/.netlify/functions/fetch-joke)

### Redirects and proxies

Netlify's Redirects API can provide friendlier URLs as proxies to these URLs.

- [/api/hello](/api/hello)
- [/api/fetch-joke](/api/fetch-joke) -->
