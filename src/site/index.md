<h2 id="about" data-scroll-point>👩🏻‍💻 About</h2>

I'm a "front of the frontend" developer who spends most of my time these days building products in React. (Don't tell the programmers, but CSS is my favorite! 🤫) 

I believe there is no "definition of done" without accessibility.

In my free time, I frequent <a href="http://meetup.com/reactjsdallas" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ReactJS Dallas</a> and <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/dfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Women Who Code DFW</a> meetups, eat good meals with <a href="http://www.thejoyfulbelly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">my spouse</a> (a chef!), explore with my basset hound mix <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dammitmacklin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Burt Macklin</a>, volunteer at <a href="https://jfsdallas.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jewish Family Service</a>, and teach ninth grade <a href="https://www.tedallas.org/learning/youth-learning-engagement/9th-12th-grade" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sunday School</a>.
