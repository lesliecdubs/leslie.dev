I found out at the beginning of the month that my high school boyfriend {% externalLink 'Matthew Driver', 'https://www.legendsfuneralhome.com/obituary/Matthew-Driver' %} died by suicide on May 22nd.

As teenagers, our relationship had grown out of our shared experiences of depression and self-harm. At an age when it’s not unusual to feel misunderstood, we found a deep connection to what felt like the darkest parts of each other.

But we also had fun.

He gave me the silliest nicknames, a few of which I’m not sure I’ll ever escape. We drove around in his SUV listening to Bright Eyes. We shared queso at Taco Cabana and made tamales with his family and I ate the pancakes he made for me in his childhood kitchen. 

I dragged him to school dances; he even smiled in some of the pictures I took, which wasn't something he normally did. We watched “The Exorcist” and “Return of the Living Dead” more times than I can count. We were both prolific posters on LiveJournal, and wouldn't let each other's entries go by without a comment.

He made me handmade cards with stickers and silly drawings, and I made him a scrapbook for our one year anniversary. He stumbled across it a few years ago and sent me photos; it was simultaneously painful and funny to look at.

We emailed each other constantly, and I still have most of them (at least, the ones he sent after bullying me into switching from Netscape to Gmail). When I search my inbox for his goofy old email address, I can easily end up on page 350 “of many.”

We made each other mix CDs, most of which were 90% Bright Eyes. “Something Vague” was our favorite song; it was included on every single mix:

> But now I'm confused.<br />
Is this death really you?<br />
Do these dreams have any meaning?<br />
No. No, I think it's more like a ghost<br />
That's been following us both.<br />
Something vague that we're not seeing,<br />
Something more like a feeling.<br />

He gave me a ring. We experienced a lot of firsts together.

It didn’t end well, but that’s probably true of most high school relationships. As is typical, graduation became a natural ending and simultaneous new beginning.

Matthew reached back out to me in 2017 and we started up where we left off, messaging back and forth every few months. I felt guilty that he was (still) mired in depression, trying to survive addiction and an abusive relationship. 

Everyone has their challenges, but I was in a good place: I had gotten married in 2015, moved to Texas, and was busy with my first remote dev job.

If I’m being honest, I gave him a lot of tough love during those conversations. But he kept messaging me, and I was always there. 

We were still inextricably connected. The past is a strong drug.

The last time we talked was a month before he died. He seemed to be doing well, at least based on what he told me: he was celebrating 30 days sober and finishing his first semester back at college.

(He was studying computer science, which he'd also taken in high school. I now realize Matthew's interest in CS helped spur mine; it's part of the reason I’m a software engineer. We talked a lot in those later years about what his coding career could look like.)

I had told him a few months back that {% externalLink 'Bright Eyes was putting out a new album', 'https://www.loudersound.com/features/bright-eyes-reunion-welcoming-back-the-band-who-helped-us-survive-the-2000s' %} after a nine year hiatus. Our final conversation started because he wanted to know if I’d heard their latest song. 

I hadn't, so I listened to it. And then I sent him this sadly hopeful Matt Hires song, which reminded me a bit of early Conor Oberst on “Fevers and Mirrors.”

The song is about death, but also about life being what you make it.

It is the last song I will ever send him.

I felt silly and self-important for crying so much the week I found out Matthew died. It was the same week the world had started reeling from the news of {% externalLink 'George Floyd’s murder', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html' %} at the hands of the police (during a {% externalLink 'global pandemic', 'https://covidtracking.com/' %}, no less). 

I felt guilty for having such a strong reaction to Matthew’s death. Dying is a big deal, but it felt like a very personal sidebar during a world uprising about systemic injustice, against a backdrop of overflowing hopsitals and makeshift morgues.

Matthew’s death wouldn't change my day-to-day much, if at all. He wasn’t a fixture of my life anymore.

But he had been.

My friend {% externalLink 'Kate Kaput', 'https://twitter.com/katekaput' %} lost her high school boyfriend to suicide in 2005. She has written {% externalLink 'about Dave', 'https://www.greatestescapist.com/search?q=dave' %} a lot since then, and {% externalLink 'many of her words', 'https://www.greatestescapist.com/2020/02/second-thoughts-paper-hearts.html' %} have meant so much to me over these past few weeks:

> To remember love lost, to honor a life lost, to reflect **on the ways that someone's life & death changed your fundamental existence**... that's not weird. That is very, very normal.

These words gave me permission to grieve. 

To acknowledge that this loss has a real and deep impact, and that it’s not only okay but necessary to process it. It’s okay to talk about him, to write about him, to share that writing.

To remember who he was at 15 and 16 and 17 and 18 and the impact his life had on mine, then and now.

These words have also reminded me what actually matters at the end of the day. Or at the end of a life.

It's about finding those people you click into like a puzzle piece, and working every day to make each other better. It’s about _really_ listening. 

It’s about spending more time on things you care about and less on things you don’t. Choosing work that has a meaningful and positive influence on the world. Honoring and thanking the people who have shaped who you are. Telling them you love them.

It’s about standing up, together, for what’s right. 

For me, now, it’s about being open and honest about the impact of suicide. It’s about remembering Matthew and finding ways I can {% externalLink 'support people', 'https://www.jedfoundation.org/' %} who struggle with mental illness. It's about challenging myself to engage in the fight against injustice that is so apparent in our world.

It’s also about allowing myself - forcing myself, even - to take the time and space to feel each painful feeling as it comes up because I have to. There isn't another choice.

But in the end, even when staring down what feels like insurmountable anger and pain and despair, it's about knowing that we are not alone.
