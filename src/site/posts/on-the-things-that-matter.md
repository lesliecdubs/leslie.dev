title: On the things that matter

I found out at the beginning of the month that my high school boyfriend {% externalLink 'Matthew Driver', 'https://www.legendsfuneralhome.com/obituary/Matthew-Driver' %} died by suicide on May 22nd.

As teenagers, our relationship had grown out of our shared experiences of depression and self-harm. At an age when it’s not unusual to feel misunderstood, we found a deep connection to what felt like the darkest parts of each other.

But we also had fun together.

He gave me the silliest nicknames, a few of which I’m not sure I’ll ever escape. We drove around in his SUV listening to Bright Eyes; we shared queso at Taco Cabana and made tamales with his family and I ate the pancakes he made for me in his childhood kitchen. 

I dragged him to school dances; he even smiled in some of the pictures I took, not something he normally did. We watched “The Exorcist” and “Return of the Living Dead” more times than I can count. We were both prolific LifeJournal posters who commented daily on each other's work.

He made me handmade cards with stickers and silly drawings, and I made him a scrapbook for our one year anniversary.

We emailed each other constantly; I still have most of them (at least, the ones he sent after he encouraged me to switch from Netscape to Gmail). When I search my Gmail for his goofy old email address, I can easily end up on page 350 “of many.”

We made each other mix CDs, most of which were 90% Bright Eyes; I realize now that doesn't really make it a mix CD, but what can you do. “Something Vague” was included on every single one.

He gave me a ring.

We experienced a lot of firsts together.

It didn’t end well, but that’s true of a lot of relationships. As is typical, graduation became a natural ending and simultaneous new beginning.

Matthew reached back out to me in 2017 and we started up where we left off, messaging back and forth every few months. I felt guilty that he was (still) mired in depression, trying to survive addiction and an abusive relationship. 

Everyone has their challenges, but I was in a good place: I had gotten married in 2015, moved to Texas, and was learning so much as a front end developer at my first remote job. We were soon to be in the process of buying our first house. 

If I’m being honest, I gave him quite a bit of tough love during those conversations. But he kept messaging me and I was always there. 

We were still inextricably connected. The past is a strong drug.

The last time we talked was a month before he died. He seemed to be doing well, at least based on what he told me: he was celebrating 30 days sober and finishing his first semester back at college.

(He was studying computer science, which he'd also taken in high school. I now realize Matthew's interest in CS helped spur mine, and is probably a part of the reason I’m a software engineer today. We talked a lot in those later years about what his coding career could look like.)

I had told him a few months back that {% externalLink 'Bright Eyes was putting out a new album', 'https://www.loudersound.com/features/bright-eyes-reunion-welcoming-back-the-band-who-helped-us-survive-the-2000s' %} after a long hiatus, and he messaged me to see if I’d heard their latest song. 

I listened to it, and then sent him a link to this sadly hopeful Matt Hires song that reminded me a bit of early Conor Oberst on “Fevers and Mirrors.”

The song is about death, but also about life being what you make it.

It is the last song I will ever send him.

I felt a bit silly and self-important for crying so much the week I found out Matthew died, in part because it was the same week the world was reeling from the news of {% externalLink 'George Floyd’s murder', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html' %} at the hands of the police (during a {% externalLink 'global pandemic', 'https://covidtracking.com/' %}, no less). 

I felt guilty for having such a strong reaction to Matthew’s death; it felt like a very off-topic, personal loss in the face of a world uprising about systemic injustice.

Matthew’s death wouldn't change my day-to-day much, if at all. He wasn’t a fixture of my life anymore.

But he had been.

My friend {% externalLink 'Kate Kaput', 'https://twitter.com/katekaput' %} lost her high school boyfriend to suicide in 2005. She has written {% externalLink 'about Dave', 'https://www.greatestescapist.com/search?q=dave' %} a lot since then, and {% externalLink 'many of her words', 'https://www.greatestescapist.com/2020/02/second-thoughts-paper-hearts.html' %} have meant so much to me over these past few weeks:

> To remember love lost, to honor a life lost, to reflect **on the ways that someone's life & death changed your fundamental existence**... that's not weird. That is very, very normal.

These words gave me permission to grieve. 

To acknowledge that this loss has a real and deep impact and that it’s not only okay but necessary to process it. To know that it’s okay to talk about him, and write about him, and share that writing.

To remember who he was at 15 and 16 and 17 and 18 and the impact his life had on mine, then and now.

It’s also reminded me what matters at the end of a day, or the end of a life: our impact on each other. 

It’s about finding those people you click into like a puzzle piece, and then working every day to make each other better. It’s about _really_ listening to each other. 

It’s about spending more of your time on things you care about and less on things you don’t, and choosing work that has a meaningful and positive influence on the world. It’s about honoring and thanking the people who help shape who you are. 

It’s about standing up, together, for what’s right. 

For me, now, it’s about being open and honest about the impact of suicide. It’s about remembering Matthew and finding ways I can support people who struggle with mental illness. It’s about educating myself on Black history, challenging my assumptions and committing to being an anti-racist.

It’s also about allowing myself - forcing myself, even - to take the time and space to feel every single painful feeling that’s coming up right now. 

And knowing that, in the insurmountable face of anger and pain and grief, I am not alone.
